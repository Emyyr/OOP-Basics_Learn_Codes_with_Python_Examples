"""
soccer_1_name = "Messi"
soccer_1_age = "35"
soccer_1_team = "Paris"

# if you save soccer player's informations like messi you don't have to write like this. 
# We use class

class Soccer(object): #or we can write class Soccer()
    #attribute = age,play team etc.
    #behevior  = forvet,goal etc.
    pass
# Attribute 
# Now try to add some attributes in our class

class Footboller():
    
    age=30
    team = "Galatasaray"
    pass
# add one veriable for footballer class
    
Ronaldo = Footboller()
print(Ronaldo.age)
print(Ronaldo.team),
# Try to change atrribute value 

Ronaldo.team = "Fenerbahce"
print(Ronaldo.team)
# We change a veriable but this is not propose.
